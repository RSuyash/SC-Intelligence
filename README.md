# CS-Intelligence

CS-Intelligence is a Python-based tool that enhances your Zettelkasten workflow by automatically generating "Maps of Content" (MOCs) for your notes. It leverages the power of Google's Gemini API and the Smart Connections plugin for Obsidian to analyze your knowledge base, identify related concepts, and synthesize insightful connections.

## Features

- **Automated MOC Generation:** Creates well-structured MOCs that provide a high-level overview of interconnected ideas.
- **Semantic Similarity:** Uses vector embeddings from Smart Connections to find semantically related notes.
- **LLM-Powered Synthesis:** Employs the Gemini API to generate a title, core idea, key details, and body for each MOC.
- **Customizable Templates:** Allows you to define the structure and front matter of your MOCs using a template file.
- **Obsidian Integration:** Designed to work seamlessly with your Obsidian vault and the Smart Connections plugin.

## How It Works

1.  **Read Smart Connections Data:** The tool reads the note and block-level embeddings generated by the Smart Connections plugin from your vault's `.smart-env` directory.
2.  **Find Similar Notes:** When you specify a target note, it calculates the cosine similarity between the target note's embedding and all other notes in your vault to find the most closely related ones.
3.  **Generate Prompt:** It constructs a detailed prompt for the Gemini API, including the content of the target note and its most similar neighbors.
4.  **Invoke Gemini API:** The prompt is sent to the Gemini API, which returns a JSON object containing the synthesized MOC content.
5.  **Create MOC Note:** The tool then uses a predefined template to format the generated content and saves it as a new Markdown file in your designated MOCs folder.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- An active Google Gemini API key
- Obsidian with the Smart Connections plugin installed and configured

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/CS-Intelligence.git
    ```
2.  Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Configure the tool by editing the `config.ini` file:
    - Set `vault_path` to the absolute path of your Obsidian vault.
    - Set `moc_save_path` to the folder where you want to save your MOCs.
    - Set `moc_template_path` to the path of your MOC template file.
    - Set `gemini_api_key` to your Google Gemini API key.

### Usage

To generate a MOC for a new note, run the `knowledge_architect.py` script with the `-p` or `--process-file` argument, followed by the relative path of the note within your vault:

```bash
python knowledge_architect.py -p "UPSC/GS2/Polity.md"
```

Alternatively, you can run the script without any arguments and it will prompt you to enter the relative path of the note.

## Key Components

- **`knowledge_architect.py`:** The main script that orchestrates the MOC generation process.
- **`sc_reader.py`:** A class that reads and processes the data from the Smart Connections plugin.
- **`gemini_client.py`:** A client for interacting with the Google Gemini API.
- **`config.ini`:** The configuration file for specifying paths and API keys.
- **`moc_template.md`:** A template file for formatting the generated MOCs.
