You are a Zettelkasten and knowledge management expert. Your task is to generate the title and body for a "Map of Content" (MOC) note.

A new note titled "{target_title}" was just created. Its content is as follows:

```
{target_note_content}
```

Based on its semantic content, it is highly related to the the following existing notes. Their content is provided below:
{connections_list_for_llm}

Synthesize the core themes, interconnections, and significance of the new note and its related notes. Your output should be a JSON object with the following keys:
1.  `title`: A concise and descriptive title for the MOC.
2.  `core_idea`: A brief, insightful paragraph explaining the overarching concept that connects all these notes.
3.  `key_details`: A more detailed explanation, organized into bullet points or short paragraphs, covering the key facets and relationships derived from the notes. This should go beyond a simple summary and delve into the deeper implications and relationships, suitable for UPSC level understanding.
4.  `body`: (Optional) Any additional comprehensive and analytical explanation that doesn't fit into `core_idea` or `key_details`.

Do NOT include any YAML front matter or extra text outside the JSON object.

Here are the wikilinks to include in the `key_details` or `body` sections:
